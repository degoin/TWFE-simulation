# TWFE-simulation
Scripts for implementation of a simulation to evaluate the performance of TWFE and group-time ATT estimators of the ATT

This project compares the two-way fixed effects and group-time ATT estimators of the ATT in a difference-in-differences framework. 

We simulate data based on a study evaluating the effect of the ACA's Medicaid expansion on preterm birth rates in states, and evaluate how each estimator performs when there is a constant treatment effect, heterogeneous treatment effect (states that adopted later have larger treatment effects compared to those that adopted earlier), and dynamic treatment effects (the effect of expansion increases over time).
